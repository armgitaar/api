API Example using [Alpas](https://alpas.dev) as a backend.

This is a basic API example. I took the Alpas Starter and removed most of the front-end https components so that it is a
slim API. 

In this example, I've added a Task seeder so that you can connect to a database, migrate the database, and seed with
example tasks. 

I wrote an [accompanying tutorial](https://dev.to/armiedema/a-restful-api-with-an-alpas-back-end-4j8d) that you can use as well. 

Hope you find this useful!
